            In a jar (or similar sealable container, perhaps a cracked pot), combine your water and rose petals. Allow the water to infuse anywhere from 1 hour to overnight. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the rose petal water into a pot, add your sugar. Cook on low until the sugar completely dissolves. Strain into a sealable bottle, set aside. That's your rose syrup!

            For the cocktail - in a glass, combine your rose syrup, lemon juice, fresh squeezed blood orange juice, Empress 1908 gin, luster powder, and sheet of gold into a shaker. Add some ice, and shake well. Strain and pour into your flask (or any nicely presentable glassware).
