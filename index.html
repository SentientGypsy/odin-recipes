    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <u><h2>Recipes built for a Tarnish. Built for a God slayer.</h2></u>
    <h3>You've awoken, starving and scared and unaware of where you are. Before you lay three tomes, various runes and scattered markings adorn the coverings.</h3>
    <h3>An uninvited searing thought pierces your mind, it insists that you choose from the tomes.</h3>
    <h3><em> Do you resist?</em></h3>
